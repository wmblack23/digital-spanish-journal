# Flask + MongoDB Atlas Web App

- This is a simple full-stack web application built with **Flask** (Python), **MongoDB Atlas**, and **HTML/CSS/JavaScript** on the frontend.
- It's purpose is for **language learning**. The user submits a journal entry in Spanish and a Chat GPT AOPI connection on the backend returns a corrected version.
- This tool is designed to improve the Spanish language learning process through writing and keeping all of a users' entries in an easy to use location.
- Users can effortlessly scroll through weeks or months of their Spanish blogs and track where they have improved and what they need to continue to study.
- **Simplicity** is the core design concept. It is solely a web application for storing Spanish writing and getting immediate feedback from the Chat GPT API.
